# AI Generator SDK Implementation Plan
*App Proxy-Only Approach - 4 Week Timeline*

## Week 1: Core SDK Foundation

### 🔧 Build System & Configuration
- [ ] **setup-build-system**: Set up Vite build pipeline for single-bundle SDK targeting extensions/theme-extension/assets/
- [✅] **configure-app-proxy**: Configure Shopify App Proxy in shopify.app.toml with prefix='tools' and subpath='ai-studio'
- [ ] **create-backend-proxy-routes**: Create app/routes/tools/ai-studio/api/ directory structure with basic routes (hello, products, generations)

### 🎯 SDK Core Development  
- [ ] **migrate-page-detection-logic**: Extract isProductPage(), getPageType(), and isThemeEditor() logic from block.liquid into SDK core
- [ ] **create-sdk-core-class**: Build main AIGeneratorSDK class with auto-initialization and page type detection
- [ ] **build-simple-api-client**: Create AIGeneratorAPI class with App Proxy-only endpoints (no auth complexity)
- [ ] **test-app-proxy-connection**: Verify App Proxy routing works end-to-end from theme extension to backend

## Week 2: Product Page Features

### 🎨 UI Components
- [ ] **create-style-selector-component**: Build React component for AI style selection with product-specific styles
- [ ] **create-image-upload-component**: Build React component for customer image upload with validation and preview

### 🔄 Generation Workflow
- [ ] **implement-generation-flow**: Build complete generation workflow: upload → style selection → generation → polling for completion
- [ ] **add-polling-mechanism**: Implement polling-based status updates for generation progress (3-second intervals)
- [ ] **integrate-with-product-form**: Replace block.liquid placeholder with React-rendered AI generation UI
- [ ] **implement-cart-integration**: Add generation metadata to cart line items and create hidden form fields

## Week 3: Enhanced Features

### 🛒 Cart & Progress
- [ ] **create-cart-page-features**: Build cart page components to display AI generation info and reorder functionality
- [ ] **add-progress-indicators**: Create visual progress indicators and loading states for generation process
- [ ] **implement-error-handling**: Add comprehensive error handling with user-friendly error messages and fallbacks

### ⚡ Performance
- [ ] **optimize-bundle-size**: Optimize Vite build for minimal bundle size and efficient loading
- [ ] **add-http-caching**: Implement proper HTTP cache headers in backend routes for performance

## Week 4: Polish & Deploy

### 🧪 Testing
- [ ] **test-theme-integration**: Test SDK integration across different Shopify themes and ensure compatibility
- [ ] **mobile-responsive-testing**: Test and optimize mobile experience for AI generation workflow
- [ ] **cross-browser-testing**: Test functionality across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### 📚 Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] **create-integration-docs**: Write documentation for theme developers on how to integrate the SDK
- [ ] **setup-production-deployment**: Configure production deployment pipeline and environment variables
- [ ] **setup-monitoring**: Add basic monitoring for API endpoints and error tracking

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Week 1 Complete**: Basic SDK loads on product pages, App Proxy routes working
**Week 2 Complete**: Full generation workflow functional end-to-end
**Week 3 Complete**: Cart integration, error handling, performance optimized
**Week 4 Complete**: Production-ready with docs and monitoring

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Start Here**: Mark "setup-build-system" as in-progress
2. **App Proxy**: Configure your shopify.app.toml file
3. **Backend Routes**: Create the /tools/ai-studio/api/ structure
4. **Test Early**: Verify App Proxy connection before building UI
